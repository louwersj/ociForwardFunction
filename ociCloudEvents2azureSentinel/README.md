## Configuration
To be able to configure the integration you will need some information from Azure. For the integration to work the "workspace ID" and the "primary Key" (or secondary key) are needed. Those can be retreived via the "Agent Management" settings in your Log Analytics Workspace in Micrsoft Azure. The below screenshot shows where the information can be retrieved.
